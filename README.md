# Hi there 👋

I'm **Ilie Daniel Rus**, and I'm passionate about building software that works — whether it's a small multiplayer game or an application that helps manage real-world data.

### 🚀 About Me

I'm a recent **Computer Science graduate from UBB Cluj-Napoca**, currently exploring the intersection between software, systems design and project management. I thrive on challenges and love bringing structure to chaos — be it in code or in people-centered projects.

🧠 I enjoy simplifying problems, organizing work, and creating value through clarity and collaboration.
